# Development verification

Local checks exercised the synthetic parser/writer, Qt navigation/edit/save, actual Windows converter, interruption cleanup, source preconditions, malicious ZIP rejection and cross-part copy/patch workflows. Private read-only game integration and separate generated-output verification also ran; environment-specific results are excluded from public documentation.

Commands: pytest, compileall, CLI --help, studio --smoke, studio --verify-game --game PRIVATE_PATH, Ruff and mypy on the new studio/patch-package modules. Test groups distinguish unit, integration, gui, windows and real_game. Public CI must skip the private fixture when absent. Converter tests use generated inputs.

Initial Ubuntu CI exposed missing libEGL.so.1; the workflow installs the required Qt runtime libraries and allows both platforms to complete independently. The corrected prior CI commit passed Windows/Linux and standalone packaging. Subsequent code requires its own observed checks.

Original files were read only; output patch and untouched ranges were verified separately. Runtime PS3/RPCS3 verification: NOT RUN. Unsupported layouts, geometry import/export and unknown roster semantics remain documented limitations. This is not completion or publication of v1.0beta.
