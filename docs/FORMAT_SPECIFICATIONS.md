# Format specification index

Canonical layouts/confidence remain in PROJECT_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md, FORMAT_NOTES.md and preserved MASTER_HANDOFF.md. This rebuild does not replace their evidence with guesses.

Archive AA00B3BF: BE alignment/part count/entry count; UTF-16BE part names; offsets in alignment units. Stored sizes on this fixture are invalid and bounded extents derive from next offset/logical end. Derived status remains visible.
IFF FF3BEF94/CDF F0985030: relative target = pointer field + value - 1. ROST: signed target = pointer field + delta. Standard IFF offsets are block logical positions; CDF physical payload positions must use secondary descriptors, never virtual offsets.
Name tables AA171516: BE magic, LE length/pointers, UTF-16LE strings. Unknown words, headers/trailers, block order and shared-slice identities remain preserved. H7A logical-size-preserving encoding reuses valid token choices; capacity must fit original allocation.
SCNE declarations/indices/materials are inspected read-only; no stable geometry writer claim. Verified texture/roster field contracts remain in TEXTURE_CONVERSION.md and ROSTER_EDITOR.md. Tests include malformed slices/pointers, overlap, wrappers, capacity, source hash mismatch and untouched byte identity.
